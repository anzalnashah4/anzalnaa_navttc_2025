   <h1>This is my page</h1>
   <b><p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages, structuring content like text, headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links. 
    An HTML file is a text-based file that is used to structure the content of a webpage. So, you may write your HTML code in Notepad or TextEdit and then copy it into a professional HTML editor such as Adobe Dreamweaver. You can also write code directly into Dreamweaver or another website building tool.
